# Heart Disease Prediction using ECG with AI and Health Assistant Chatbot

This project is an **AI-powered platform for predicting heart disease** using **electrocardiogram (ECG) signals**. It combines advanced **machine learning techniques** with **feature engineering** and a **health assistant chatbot** to provide real-time predictions and basic health guidance. The goal is to help individuals and medical professionals identify potential heart-related risks early and take preventive action.

## Key Features
- **Heart Disease Prediction:** Analyzes ECG signals and predicts the likelihood of heart disease.  
- **Comprehensive Feature Engineering:** Extracts morphological, time-domain, frequency-domain, and nonlinear features from ECG signals for robust predictions.  
- **Health Assistant Chatbot:** Provides recommendations and answers basic questions related to heart health.  
- **Real-Time Analysis:** Supports real-time ECG data processing for quick feedback.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Designed for both medical and non-medical users.

## How It Works
1. Upload or collect ECG data (image or signal format).  
2. The system **preprocesses the ECG and performs feature engineering** (extracting morphological, temporal, frequency, and nonlinear features).  
3. AI models analyze the extracted features to predict the risk of heart disease.  
4. The chatbot provides instant guidance or next steps based on results.

## Usage
1. Open the provided Jupyter Notebook (`improved.ipynb`).  
2. Follow the steps to load ECG data into the notebook.  
3. Run the feature extraction and prediction cells to get heart disease risk output.  
4. Interact with the chatbot section for health-related recommendations.
